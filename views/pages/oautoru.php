                        <p>My name is Lazar Galic. I was born in march of 2002 and I study Internet Technologies at the 'ICT College' in Belgrade, Serbia.
                            I went to high school of electrotechnics 'Nikola Tesla' and graduated as a electrotechnician of multimedia. I came across web design
                            and internet technologies in high school for the first timeand it became one of my interests. My dream is to work for a successful company until
                            I acquire some experience in order to hopefully start my own company some day.
